A Note About Manjaro and Arch
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Manjaro is based on another distribution called Arch Linux.
 As such, it is also able to draw software packages from the community-maintaine
d Arch User Repository (AUR).
 However, please note that Manjaro is not Arch, and any enquieries about
 the Manjaro operating system should be directed towards the Manjaro forums
 and Internet Relay Chat (IRC) channels alone.
 For example, although Ubuntu is derived from Debian - and therefore shares
 some similarities with its parent - there are still substantial differences
 between these operating systems and how they work.
 Such is the case with Manjaro, which is far from just being an "easy to
 install" or "pre-configured" Arch operating system.
 Here are some of the key differences between the Manjaro and Arch operating
 systems: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Manjaro is developed independently from Arch, and by a completely different
 team.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Manjaro is designed to be accessible to newcomers, while Arch is aimed at
 experienced users.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Manjaro draws software from its own independent repositories.
 These repositories also contain software packages not provided by Arch.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Manjaro provides its own distribution-specific tools such as the Manjaro
 Hardware Detection (MHWD) utility, and the Manjaro Settings Manager (MSM).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Manjaro has numerous subtle differences in how it works when compared to
 Arch.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To reiterate, although Manjaro is indeed an Arch-derivative, it is not Arch!

\begin_layout Section
About Manjaro
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Manjaro
\series default
 is a user-friendly Linux distribution based on the independently developed
 Arch operating system.
 Within the Linux community, Arch itself is renowned for being an exceptionally
 fast, powerful, and lightweight distribution that provides access to the
 very latest cutting-edge - and bleeding-edge - software.
 However, Arch is also aimed at more experienced or technically-minded users.
 As such, it is generally considered to be beyond the reach of those who
 lack the technical expertise (or persistence) required to use it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Developed in Austria, France, and Germany, Manjaro provides all the benefits
 of the Arch operating system combined with a focus on user-friendliness
 and accessibility.
 Available in both 32- and 64-bit versions, Manjaro is suitable for newcomers
 as well as experienced Linux users.
 For newcomers, a user-friendly installer is provided, and the system itself
 is designed to work fully 'straight out of the box' with features including:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Pre-installed desktop environments
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Pre-installed graphical applications to easily install software and update
 your system, and
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Pre-installed codecs to play multimedia files
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Features
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Manjaro shares many of the same features as Arch, including:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Speed, power, and efficiency
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Access to the very latest cutting- and bleeding-edge software
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A 'rolling release' development model that provides the most up-to-date
 system possible without the need to install new versions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Access to the Arch User Repositories, and
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The versatility to be shaped and 
\lang british
moulded
\lang english
 in every respect to suit personal taste and preference.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, Manjaro boasts a few extra features of its own, including:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A simplified, user-friendly installation process
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Automatic detection of your computer's hardware (e.g.
 graphics cards)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Automatic installation of the necessary software (e.g.
 graphics drivers) for your system
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

Downloading Manjaro
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
32- and 64-bit versions of Manjaro are available for download as ISO files.
 An ISO file is itself a literal copy of a disc image, although not in the
 same sense as a copy-and-paste duplication.
 Rather, it is a copy of the raw data that makes up the files and folders
 of that disc.
 This is why just copying an ISO file to a disc (or USB flashdrive) to begin
 installing it won't work - you'll need to use a disc burning application
 to translate that raw data into the files and folders.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Note: There is an exception to this rule.
 If you intend on installing Manjaro in a virtual machine environment using
 Oracle's Virtualbox, then there will be no need to burn the image as Virtualbox
 will be able to read from the ISO file directly as a virtual disc.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Instructions to do so for both Linux and Windows operating systems are
 provided below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ISO images available for 32-bit systems will end in
\series bold
 i686.iso
\series default
, while images for 64-bit systems will end in 
\series bold
x86_64.iso
\series default
.
 Please try to ensure that you download the appropriate ISO image for your
 system as: a 64-bit ISO won't run on a 32-bit system, and a 32-bit ISO
 will not be able use the full power or resources of a 64-bit system (though
 it will still work).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Manjaro Editions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two editions of Manjaro available for download:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
The
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Full
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

edition This edition of Manjaro comes complete with a pre-installed desktop
 environment.
 In the case of the XFCE edition, it will also come with popular software
 applications, and codecs.
 This would of course be the most appropriate choice for those who wish
 to try out Manjaro on a Live-CD 
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
When you purchase retail software it generally comes on a disc, whether
 a CD or a DVD.
 A 'Live-CD' has a version of the operating system that will run without
 needing to be installed.
 This is a feature of operating systems similar to Manjaro Linux.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 without having to install it first.
 An ISO image for a full edition of Manjaro will list the pre-installed
 desktop environment in its name.
 For example, an ISO image beginning with
\series bold
 manjaro-xfce
\series default
 will have the XFCE desktop environment pre-installed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
The
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

NET
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

edition This edition of Manjaro provides only a base installation, stripped
 of all but the most basic pre-installed software.
 Starting from the command line, this is suitable for more experienced users
 who may wish to build their own Manjaro systems from the ground up.
 An ISO image for a NET edition will always begin with 
\series bold
manjaro-net
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Downloading an ISO Image
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each stable release and test-build of Manjaro has its own particular download
 location which will contain all the available 32- and 64-bit versions for
 both the full and NET editions.
 Each location will also contain the relevant checksum files which can be
 used to check the integrity of your downloaded ISO file (i.e.
 to ensure that it has not been corrupted during download).
 A link to the guide on doing this has been provided below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\begin_layout Chapter
Checking a Downloaded ISO File for Errors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Prior to burning your downloaded ISO image (or using it as a virtual disc
 in Virtualbox), it is strongly recommended that you first check that it
 hasn't been corrupted.
 The consequences of not doing so, especially if you intend on installing
 Manjaro as your main operating system, should be obvious.
 In the best case, the installation will fail.
 In the worst case a corrupted image will result in a corrupted installation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To verify the integrity of the ISO image you must first download the appropriate
 checksum file from the same Sourceforge location as your chosen ISO image.
 The file 
\series bold
manjaro-0.8.9-sha1sum.txt 
\series default
contains checksum hashes for all the available ISO files and will have content
 similar to this:

\begin_layout Section
MD5 and SHA-21
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You may have seen there are two checksum files.
 One ends -sha1sum.txt, the other ends -md5sum.txt.
 MD5 and SHA are two types of hashing algorithms; the 'sha' part of the
 checksum file name stands for 
\series bold
Secure Hash Algorithm
\series default
.
 These algorithms are used to generate a hash code unique to the ISO image
 file.
 Copies of the file can be checked to make sure they are exactly the same
 - if the file is changed in any way, either intentionally or by corruption,
 the code generated will be different.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whilst MD5 is commonly used, SHA-1 is newer and more secure and is beginning
 to replace MD5.
 For the purpose of checking the integrity of the downloaded file MD5 is
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

good enough
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 but SHA-1 is a better solution.
 The checking process is the same for both algorithms.
 We recommend you use SHA-1.
 For more information about hashing algorithms Wikipedia has lots of information.

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The checksum file itself is just a text document that contains hash codes
 that should match the code generated by the MD5 or SHA-1 algorithm.
 If the code generated from the ISO file matches that contained in the checksum
 file, then the ISO is fine.
 If the two codes don't match then it means that the ISO file has changed
 in some way, most likely due to being corrupted.
 You can think of it like someone using a password to identify who they
 are: if they provide the wrong password, then something is obviously amiss!
 Don't worry if this all sounds a bit much - it's actually very straightforward
 and easy to use!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From this point on we'll assume you are using the file 
\series bold
manjaro-0.8.9-sha1sum.txt
\series default
.
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Test builds have a slightly different arrangement.
 Instead of a single file with all checksums, each ISO file has its own
 associated checksum file.
 If you're running the test build I'm sure you can work it out!

\begin_layout Section
Checking In Linux
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Automatic verification
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The program 
\family typewriter
sha1sum 
\family default
can automatically compare the checksum of the ISO file you downloaded against
 the value in the text file.
 The process is very straightfoward, but the end result might look a little
 worrying!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For this example, I first open a terminal and chang to the directory where
 I downloaded the ISO file and checksum file.
 I use the command 
\family typewriter
ls
\family default
 to check which files are present:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
jonathon@box:~$ cd download
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
jonathon@box:~/download$ ls
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
manjaro-0.8.9-sha1sum.txt  manjaro-xfce-0.8.9-x86_64.iso
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As you can see I have downloaded the 64-bit XFCE edition.
 Next, I run the 
\family typewriter
sha1sum
\family default
 program to check against the values in the checksum file:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
jonathon@box:~/download$ sha1sum -c manjaro-0.8.9-sha1sum.txt
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next set of lines show the result of the checks.
 While the first few lines look worrying this is to be expected - the program
 can't check ISO files that aren't there! The second to last line is the
 important one.
 It shows that 
\family typewriter
sha1sum
\family default
 has successfully verified the ISO file I downloaded against the checksum
 value in the file.
